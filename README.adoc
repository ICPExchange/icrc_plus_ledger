= ICRC-2 Plus Ledger

The ICRC-2+ protocol is an enhanced version of the ICRC-2 protocol developed by the ICPEx team. It aims to enrich the functions of the ICRC-2 protocol and make the ICRC-2 protocol more competitive with the token standards of other public chains. The ICRC-2+ protocol is compatible with both the ICRC-2 and ICRC-1 protocols. Users can import ICRC-2+ protocol tokens just like ICRC-2/ICRC-1 protocol tokens without any additional operations.

== New Features List
=== 1. Burn Fee

A fixed amount or percentage of tokens will be sent to the burn address for each on-chain transfer.

=== 2. Transfer Fee

A fixed amount or percentage of tokens will be sent to the creator's address for each on-chain transfer.

=== 3. Number of Token Holders

Users can view the number of token holders of the ICRC-2 tokens.

=== 4. Distribution of Holdings

Users can view the distribution of holdings of the ICRC-2 tokens.

=== 5. View the Amount of Cycles in the Token Canister

Users can view the amount of cycles in the ICRC-2 token canister.

=== 6. Relinquish Ownership of the Token Canister

The token creator can transfer ownership of the token canister to the black hole address(aaaaa_aa).


== Method Calling Guide
=== 1. Burn Fee Calculation

Users can call the "icrc1_metadata" method to return the Burn Fee.

*(1) Burn Fee in Fixed Amount Mode*

After calling the "icrc1_metadata" method, check the return result of the "icrc1:burn_fee" field.

Example:

When this method of canister pbuvh-yiaaa-aaaam-acfpq-cai is called, the return value of the "icrc1:burn_fee" field is 1_000_000_000_000_000. Considering that its decimals is 18, the Burn Fee is 0.001. The details of the return result are shown in the figure below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-17-11-263.png[]

Or you can call the "icrc_plus_fee_info" method to check the return result of the "burn_fee" field, as shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-18-06-987.png[]

*(2) Burn Fee in Percentage Mode*

After calling the "icrc1_metadata" method, check the return result of the "icrc1:burn_fee_rate" field and divide by 10,000 to get the percentage rate.

Example:

When calling the method of canister o64gq-3qaaa-aaaam-acfla-cai, the method returns a burn_fee_rate value of 100, as shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-19-20-216.png[]

Therefore, the Burn Fee Rate is 100/10,000 = 1%.

=== 2. Transfer Fee Calculation

Users can call the "icrc1_metadata" method to return the Transfer Fee.

*(1) Transfer Fee in Fixed Amount Mode*

After calling the "icrc1_metadata" method, check the return result of the "icrc1:fee" field.

Example:

When the method of canister zuwx2-fyaaa-aaaam-ack3q-cai is called, the return value of the "icrc1:fee" field is 10_000_000. Considering that its decimals is 8, the Transfer Fee is 0.1. The details of the return result are shown in the figure below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-22-46-664.png[]

Or you can call the "icrc_plus_fee_info" method to check the return result of the "transfer_fee" field, as shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-23-04-079.png[]

*(2)Transfer Fee in Percentage Mode*

After calling the "icrc1_metadata" method, check the return result of the "icrc1:transfer_fee_rate" field and divide by 10,000 to get the percentage rate.

Example:

When calling the method of canister o64gq-3qaaa-aaaam-acfla-cai, the method returns a "transfer_fee_rate" value of 100, as shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-23-15-033.png[]

Therefore, the Transfer Fee Rate is 100/10,000 = 1%.

=== 3.Number of Token Holders

Users can call the "icrc_plus_holders_count" method to return the result.

Example:

When calling the method of canister o64gq-3qaaa-aaaam-acfla-cai, the returned value is the number of token holders, as shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-23-29-457.png[]

=== 4.Distribution of Holdings

Users can call the "icrc_plus_holders_balance" method to return the result.

Parameter 1 is the starting index.

Parameter 2 is the number of records to query.

Example:

When calling the method of canister o64gq-3qaaa-aaaam-acfla-cai with Parameter 1 as 0 and Parameter 2 as 2 (i.e., querying 2 records starting from index 0), the method returns the result as shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-23-44-418.png[]

=== 5.Amount of Cycles of Canister

Users can call the "icrc_plus_cycles" method to return the result.

Example:

When calling this method of canister o64gq-3qaaa-aaaam-acfla-cai, the method returns a value of 4_328_187_225_519, which is the number of cycles remaining for the canister. As shown below:

image::imgs/image-2024-05-31-14-24-12-162.png[]

=== 6.Relinquish Ownership of the Token Canister

Token creators can call the "icrc_plus_set_minting_account" method through a platform that has integrated the ICRC-2+ protocol to transfer the ownership of the token canister to the black hole address(aaaaa_aa).

The method is shown below.
